# AI SEO Blog & Content Cluster Generator

An AI-powered prompt system that generates SEO-optimized blogs and content clusters for business websites — the same workflow used by professional SEO agencies.

This project demonstrates how structured prompt engineering can be used to plan, generate, and scale ranking-focused content instead of writing random blog posts.

---

##  Project Overview

Most business websites fail to rank on Google because their content lacks structure, strategy, and search intent alignment.

This repository showcases a reusable AI prompt system that creates:

- Pillar SEO blogs
- Supporting content clusters
- Local SEO–focused articles
- Keyword & search intent mapping

All content is written as if it will go live on a real business website.

## Business Chosen

**Industry:** Dental Healthcare  
**Business Type:** Local Dental Clinic  
**Location:** Bangalore  

The prompts and outputs are designed for a dental clinic targeting local search traffic and patient inquiries.

## What This System Can Do

✔ Generate long-form pillar blogs  
✔ Create supporting cluster blogs (3–5 articles)  
✔ Follow SEO-friendly H1–H3 structures  
✔ Target clear search intent (informational & commercial)  
✔ Adapt content for local SEO (service + city)  
✔ Support business goals like trust, authority, and leads

##  SEO Strategy Used

This system follows a **content cluster model**, where:

- One **pillar blog** targets a high-intent keyword
- Multiple **supporting blogs** answer related user queries
- All articles are internally linked
- Google understands topical authority more clearly

This is the same structure used by SEO teams and SaaS companies.

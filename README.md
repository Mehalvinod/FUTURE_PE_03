# AI SEO Blog & Content Cluster Generator  
### Prompt Engineering Task 3 – Future Interns (2026)

##  Project Overview

Instead of writing random blog posts, this system generates **content clusters** designed to:
- Rank on Google
- Build topical authority
- Attract local, high-intent traffic
- Support business goals such as enquiries and conversions

##  SEO Strategy Used

The project follows a **pillar + cluster SEO model**:

### Pillar Blog
A long-form, authoritative article targeting a high-intent local keyword:

**“Best Coaching Institute in Bangalore – Courses, Fees & Results”**

This blog is designed to rank for competitive local searches and act as the central authority page.

### Supporting Blogs (Content Cluster)
Four supporting blogs were created to target related search intents and internally link to the pillar blog:

1. JEE Coaching Fees in Bangalore – Course Structure & Costs  
2. NEET Coaching in Bangalore – Teaching Methodology & Results  
3. Foundation Courses After Class 8 & 9 – Are They Worth It?  
4. How to Choose the Right Coaching Institute in Bangalore  

Together, these blogs strengthen topical relevance and improve SEO performance.
